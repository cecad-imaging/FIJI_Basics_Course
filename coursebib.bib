	abstract = {Photoactivated localization microscopy (PALM) is a powerful approach for investigating protein organization, yet tools for quantitative, spatial analysis of PALM datasets are largely missing. Combining pair-correlation analysis with PALM (PC-PALM), we provide a method to analyze complex patterns of protein organization across the plasma membrane without determination of absolute protein numbers. The approach uses an algorithm to distinguish a single protein with multiple appearances from clusters of proteins. This enables quantification of different parameters of spatial organization, including the presence of protein clusters, their size, density and abundance in the plasma membrane. Using this method, we demonstrate distinct nanoscale organization of plasma-membrane proteins with different membrane anchoring and lipid partitioning characteristics in COS-7 cells, and show dramatic changes in glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored protein arrangement under varying perturbations. PC-PALM is thus an effective tool with broad applicability for analysis of protein heterogeneity and function, adaptable to other single-molecule strategies.},

Although many algorithms exist for the identification and localization of molecules from raw image data, methods for analyzing the resulting point patterns for properties such as clustering have remained relatively under-studied. Here we present a model-based Bayesian approach to evaluate molecular cluster assignment proposals, generated in this study by analysis based on Ripley's K function. The method takes full account of the individual localization precisions calculated for each emitter. We validate the approach using simulated data, as well as experimental data on the clustering behavior of CD3ζ, a subunit of the CD3 T cell receptor complex, in resting and activated primary human T cells.},

The membrane targeting sequence of the N-terminal region of the T cell receptor-pathway kinase Lck fused to the photo-convertible fluorescent protein tdEos (LckN10-tdEos), clusters into sub-100 nm regions which cover ∼7\% of the cell surface. 2-channel PALM imaging of LckN10-tdEos and the N-terminus of the kinase Src (SrcN15-PS-CFP2) are demonstrated. Finally, T cell microclusters at the immune synapse are imaged at super-resolution using dSTORM, showing that conventional TIRF images contain unresolved, small clusters. These methods are generally applicable to other cell and fluorophore systems to quantify 2-D molecular clustering at nanometer scales. (© 2010 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH \& Co. KGaA, Weinheim)},

The location and physiological function of a protein are closely related; local information of a protein is thus crucial to understanding its role in biological processes. The visualization of proteins residing on intracellular structures by fluorescence microscopy has become a routine approach in cell biology and is increasingly used to assess their colocalization with well-characterized markers. However, image-analysis methods for colocalization studies are a field of contention and enigma. We have therefore undertaken to review the most currently used colocalization analysis methods, introducing the basic optical concepts important for image acquisition and subsequent analysis. We provide a summary of practical tips for image acquisition and treatment that should precede proper colocalization analysis. Furthermore, we discuss the application and feasibility of colocalization tools for various biological colocalization situations and discuss their respective strengths and weaknesses. We have created a novel toolbox for subcellular colocalization analysis under ImageJ, named JACoP, that integrates current global statistic methods and a novel object-based approach.},
